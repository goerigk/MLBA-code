# MLBA-code
Code to generate and solve multi-level bottleneck assignment problems.

It accompanies the paper on "Multi-level bottleneck assignment problems: complexity and sparsity-exploiting formulations" written by Trivikram Dokka and Marc Goerigk (see our preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12504).

Instances are generated through the "generate" function. The two main solution methods that are discussed in the paper are "solve_form1b" and "solve_sparse_var", but many more variantes were tested and are still provided in the code.
